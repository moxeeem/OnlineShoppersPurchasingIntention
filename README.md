## Project Description
In this project, we use machine learning models to analyze e-commerce data in order to determine the probability of a website visitor making a purchase.

The purpose of the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis, build one or more models to solve the task, interpret model forecasts, create an interactive dashboard and wrap it in a docker container.

## Dataset
We obtained the dataset for our analysis from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/), which provides the original dataset at this [link](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset).
The dataset consists of rows that represent visit "sessions" of users on an e-commerce website, with each row containing a feature vector of corresponding data. To ensure uniqueness of users over a 1-year period, the dataset was specifically structured so that each session belongs to a unique user. The total number of sessions in the dataset is 12,330.


**Target Variable**
- `Revenue` (categorical, bool) : whether the user has made a purchase
