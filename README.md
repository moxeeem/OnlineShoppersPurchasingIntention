## Project Description
In this project, we use machine learning models to analyze e-commerce data in order to determine the probability of a website visitor making a purchase.

The purpose of the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis, build one or more models to solve the task, interpret model forecasts, create an interactive dashboard and wrap it in a docker container.

## Dataset
We obtained the dataset for our analysis from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/), which provides the original dataset at this [link](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset).
The dataset consists of rows that represent visit "sessions" of users on an e-commerce website, with each row containing a feature vector of corresponding data. To ensure uniqueness of users over a 1-year period, the dataset was specifically structured so that each session belongs to a unique user. The total number of sessions in the dataset is 12,330.


**Target Variable**
- `Revenue` (categorical, bool) : whether the user has made a purchase

**Features**
- `Administrative` (numerical, int): the number of pages of this type (administarive) that the user visited
- `Administrative_Duration` (numerical, float): the amount of time spent in this category of pages
- `Informational` (numerical, int): the number of pages of this type (informational) that the user visited
- `Informational_Duration` (numerical, float): the amount of time spent in this category of pages
- `ProductRelated` (numerical, int): the number of pages of this type (product related) that the user visited
- `ProductRelated_Duration` (numerical, float): the amount of time spent in this category of pages
- `BounceRates` (numerical, float): the percentage of visitors who enter the website through that page and exit without triggering any additional tasks
- `ExitRates` (numerical, float): the percentage of pageviews on the website that end at that specific page
- `PageValues` (numerical, float): the average value of the page averaged over the value of the target page and/or the completion of an eCommerce
- `SpecialDay` (numerical, float): the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day
- `Month` (categorical, object): month of the year of the visiting site
- `OperatingSystems` (categorical, int): user's operating system
- `Browser` (categorical, int): user's browser
- `Region` (categorical, int): user's region
- `TrafficType` (categorical, int): traffic type
- `VisitorType` (categorical, object): visitor type (Returning_Visitor or New_Visitor or Other)
- `Weekend` (categorical, bool): is the visit day a weekend
